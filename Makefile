# a fresh one fails as a confusing cache miss rather than "you forgot to rebuild".

# Not in CI. There the build phase has already run, and on linux_amd64 it runs
# inside a container that leaves target/ owned by root -- a rebuild from the test
# phase, which runs outside the container, dies on .cargo-build-lock (EACCES).
